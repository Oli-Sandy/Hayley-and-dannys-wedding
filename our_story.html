                  We met in 2016 at some point. In a classic move this was in a Wetherspoons in Leeds, however this wasn’t the traditional meeting of two people out drinking and hitting it off – this was t6o plan a group holiday. So in January 2017 eight of us flew out to Berlin for five days. 
                  At this point Danny had a girlfriend, I was sworn off men, and Jade was trying to set me up with one of Danny’s other friends. So clearly none of this was going to plan.

                    By 2018 I was less angry with men and this time Jade was trying to set me up again – this time actually with Danny. 
                    We’d got along well in Berlin so kept in touch on and off, however he was living in Leeds and I was down in Suffolk. 
                    I was due to visit Leeds in the July to see a band, and I ended up inviting Danny to see Hereditary – he called it a date but I maintain that I asked him out. 
                    What a romantic choice for a first date… That week in Leeds is a bit of a blur now but the same group of us from Berlin played a game of beer pong. 
                    I’d not landed a single ball. I said if I landed my final shot I’d move back up north… Well I’m still here coming up eight years later…

                  Since then Danny has shaved both of our heads, we moved to Richmond together after a long distance start, survived multiple covid lockdowns, 
                  adopted two budgies and two rabbits, moved to Darlington, and done so much exploring together. 
                  I survived the most mud I’ve ever seen in my life at my first Download Festival and still went back for more. 
                  We’ve climbed mountains and Danny survived all my whinging on the ascent. 
                  We’ve visited Krakow, Rhodes, Benidorm and Corfu together since Berlin. Vegas has felt a long time coming!
